# Sanders group common workflows

This repository contains `Nextflow` implementations of common workflows used by
the Sanders research group. The current workflows I am looking to implement are:

- [x] QC pipline
- [x] Stacks (v2) pipeline
- [] CodeML
- [] Gene Capture
- [] Variant calling

If there are any other analyses that you are interested in having as a workflow,
create an issue or message me and I'll look into implementing it.

## Pipeline specifics

Please visit the wiki for detailed information regarding each sub-workflow.
